# Neural network classification

This project was part of my efforts to understand machine learning and implements a classifier in python. 

## Getting Started

Example.py shows a typical use case. As features are added, an explanation will be added here and in the code.

### Prerequisites

You will need python3, numpy, and scipy. How to install these will vary based on your setup, typically pip can be used.

### Installing

The installation procedure is rather simple, one simply has to clone the github repo.

git clone https://github.com/FelixLabelle/neural_network_expirements


## Running the tests

Currently there are no unit or integration tests. These will be added later.


### And coding style tests

So far I have used the PEP8 style guide and tested using pylinter.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
